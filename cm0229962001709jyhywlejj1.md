## What is CI (Continuous Integration)?‚ôæÔ∏è

Continuous Integration (CI) is a development practice where developers frequently integrate their code changes into a shared repository e.g. GitHub. The goal is to merge code changes from different developers as often as possible to avoid integration challenges that may arise when working in large teams.

### Process:

* **Frequent Commits:** Developers commit code changes to the central repository multiple times a day to keep the codebase up-to-date and minimize integration conflicts.
    
* **Automated Builds:** After each code commit, automated tools compile the code, resolve dependencies, and run initial tests to ensure a successful build.
    
* **Code Review:** Automated tools analyze the newly committed code for potential issues. This helps in catching bugs early in the development process.
    
* **Quick Feedback:** Developers receive immediate feedback on their changes by integrating code frequently and running automated builds and tests. This allows them to address any issues quickly, leading to higher software quality.
    

The primary objectives of Continuous Integration are to detect and fix bugs quickly, simplify the integration process across a team of developers, and reduce the time it takes to release new features.

## What is CD (Continuous Delivery)?üì¶

Continuous Delivery (CD) extends the principles of Continuous Integration by automating the process of delivering code changes to production. After the code has been integrated and tested through CI, Continuous Delivery ensures that these changes are always ready to be released to customers.

### Process:

* **Staging Environment:** This is a copy of the production environment. where integration and regression tests are run to ensure that the code functions work as expected.
    
* **Automated Testing:** By running a series of automated tests to validate that the software is stable and ready for production. e.g. User acceptance testing (UAT), performance testing, and security testing.
    
* **Release Automation:** This means that new changes can be deployed to production with the click of a button or even automatically, ensuring that the product is always in a release-ready state.
    
* **Quick Deployments:** Continuous Delivery reduces the time and effort required to release new features, bug fixes, or updates. This helps teams to deploy changes to production frequently, keeping customers satisfied with regular improvements.
    

In essence, Continuous Delivery bridges the gap between development and operations, enabling faster and more reliable releases.

## What Is a Build Job?üõ†Ô∏è

A Jenkins build job includes the setup for automating specific tasks or steps in the application-building process. These tasks involve gathering dependencies, compiling, archiving, transforming code, and testing and deploying code in different environments.

Jenkins supports several types of build jobs, such as freestyle projects, pipelines, multi-configuration projects, folders, multibranch pipelines, and organization folders.

## What is a Freestyle Project?üíª

A **freestyle project** in Jenkins is a versatile type of job that lets you automate various tasks. Whether you need to build, test, or deploy software, a freestyle project provides the flexibility to set up your CI/CD pipeline to meet your specific requirements.

## Task ‚òëÔ∏è

* Create an agent for your app (which we deployed using Docker in a previous task).
    
* Create a new Jenkins freestyle project
    
* In the "Build" section of the project, add a build step to run the `docker build` command to build the image for the container.
    
* Add a second step to run the `docker run` command to start a container using the image created in the previous step.

## ConclusionüéØ

CI/CD practices are essential for modern software development, allowing teams to deliver high-quality software quickly and reliably. By automating integration, testing, and delivery processes, CI/CD ensures our software is always ready for release. Tools like Jenkins provide powerful features, such as freestyle projects, to customize and automate your build jobs, making it easier to manage complex workflows and deployments.
