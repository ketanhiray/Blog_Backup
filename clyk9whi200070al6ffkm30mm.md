### Task 1: Comments📝

In bash scripts, comments are used to add explanatory notes or disable certain lines of code. The task is to create a bash script with comments explaining what the script does.

```powershell
ubuntu@ip-172-31-45-42:~/scripts$ vim task.sh
ubuntu@ip-172-31-45-42:~/scripts$ cat task.sh
ubuntu@ip-172-31-45-42:~/scripts$ chmod +x task.sh
ubuntu@ip-172-31-45-42:~/scripts$ ./task.sh
```

### Task 2: Echo🔊

The echo command is used to display messages on the terminal. The task is to create a bash script that uses echo to print a message of your choice.

### Task 3: Variables🔠

Variables in bash are used to store data and can be referenced by their name. The task is to create a bash script that declares variables and assigns values to them.

### Task 4: Using Variables🔡

Now that we have declared variables, let's use them to perform a simple task. Create a bash script that takes two variables (numbers) as input and prints their sum using those variables.

### Task 5: Using Built-in Variables🔤

Bash provides several built-in variables that hold useful information. The task is to create a bash script that utilizes at least three different built-in variables to display relevant information.

### Task 6: Wildcards✳

Wildcards are special characters used to perform pattern matching when working with files. The task is to create a bash script that utilizes wildcards to list all the files with a specific extension in a directory.

In this script, we covered fundamental concepts of bash scripting. We added comments for readability, used the echo command to print a message, worked with variables, demonstrated built-in variables, and used wildcards to list files with a specific extension. This provides a foundational understanding of bash scripting for DevOps tasks and automation. Happy scripting! 🚀
