### What is Python?üêâ

Python is an open-source, versatile, and easy-to-read programming language created by Guido van Rossum in 1991. It supports various programming paradigms, making it suitable for various applications.

One of Python's strengths is its extensive standard library and the availability of numerous third-party libraries and frameworks. Notable examples include:

* **Django**: A high-level web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.
    
* **TensorFlow**: An open-source library for machine learning and artificial intelligence, widely used for deep learning applications.
    
* **Flask**: A lightweight WSGI web application framework that is easy to use and scales well for small to medium-sized projects.
    
* **Pandas**: A powerful data manipulation and analysis library, essential for data science and analytics tasks.
    
* **Keras**: An open-source software library that provides a Python interface for neural networks, running on top of TensorFlow or Theano.

### Data types in Python‚å®

In Python, understanding data types is crucial, as it determines how the language handles different kinds of data. Here's a brief overview of the main data types in Python:

### 1\. **Numeric Types**

* **Integer (**int): Represents whole numbers
    
* **Float (**float): Represents floating-point numbers, i.e., numbers with a decimal point
    
* **Complex (**complex): Represents complex numbers, consisting of a real part and an imaginary part
    
* ```python
    # Numeric Types
    x = 10          # int
    y = 3.14        # float
    z = 3 + 4j      # complex
    ```
    

### 2\. **Sequence Types**

* **String (**str): Represent textual data
    
* **List (**list): An ordered collection of elements, which can be of different data types. <mark> Lists are mutable</mark>, meaning their contents can be changed
    
* **Tuple (**tuple): Similar to lists, but <mark>immutable</mark>, meaning once created, their contents cannot be changed
    
* ```python
    # Sequence Types
    s = "Hello, World!"  # str
    lst = [1, 2, 3, 4]   # list
    tpl = (5, 6, 7, 8)   # tuple
    ```
    

### 3\. **Mapping Type**

* **Dictionary (**dict): An unordered collection of key-value pairs, where keys are unique. This structure allows for efficient data retrieval based on keys
    
* ```python
    # Mapping Type
    d = {"name": "Ketan", "age": 30}  # dict
    ```
    

### 4\. **Set Types**

* **Set (**set): An unordered collection of unique elements, useful for membership testing and eliminating duplicate entries.
    
* **Frozen Set (**frozenset): An <mark> immutable </mark> version of a <mark>set</mark>, which means that once created, it cannot be modified.
    
* ```python
    # Set Types
    st = {1, 2, 3, 4}                # set
    fst = frozenset([5, 6, 7, 8])    # frozenset
    ```
    

### 5\. **Boolean Type**

* **Boolean (**bool): Represents one of two values: *True* or *False*. This data type is commonly used in conditional expressions and logical operations.
    
* ```python
    # Boolean Type
    flag = True   # bool
    ```
    

### 6\. **None Type**

**NoneType:** Represents the absence of a value

```python
data = None
```

## Conclusion‚úç

Python offers various data types, including numeric (integers, floats), sequences (strings, lists), mapping (dictionaries), and sets. Mastering these types is crucial for proficient Python programming.
